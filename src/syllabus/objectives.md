# Objectives

At the end of this course, the student will be able to:

1. Explain the fundamentals of long-read sequencing and its advantages over short-read sequencing in pathogen genomics and metagenomics applications.
2. Utilize long-read sequencing platforms and tools for accurate assembly of complex genomes of plant and animals pathogens.
3. Analyze long-read sequencing data to identify genomics variations, structural variants, and pathogenicity or virulence factors.
4. Utilize long-read sequencing platforms and tools for acurate assembly and analysis of near full-length 16S/ITS amplicons for microbial community studies.
5. Evaluate recent research and case studies demonstrating the impact of long-read sequencing on understanding and managing plant and animal pathogens and metagenomics.
